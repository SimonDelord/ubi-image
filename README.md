# ubi-image
This is a docker File that can be used for debugging (network toolings, various clis, etc...)
I've reused as a basis the docker File from MikeJMcGuire/RHUtilsContainer - see here https://github.com/MikeJMcGuire/RHUtilsContainer/tree/master
as a basis and modified it over time.

Next step will be to do the same for ubi9.
cheers
